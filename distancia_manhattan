import numpy as np #importing numpy library

x = [2, 3, 5, 2, 4] #values for x
y = [10, 15, 20, 30, 12] #values for y

dist = np.sum([abs(x-y) for (x,y) in zip(x,y)]) 
#abs -> calcute the absolute value for diferente between x-value and y-value
#zip -> compresses the lists forming pairs according to the position of each index
    
print(dist) #shows the results
